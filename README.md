  In this project I used pandas and pillow module.pillow for viewing 

certificate template and drawing names and details on them by using 

default keys in pillow such as image,imagefont,imagedraw .i created a 

excel file as csv which contains participants list and their details and i 

imported the excel file in program using pandas module .i used to dict 

key for using excel as dict if we used name in excel which has all the 

names like that for all .I used imagedraw in pillow module for writing 

names and details in certificate and I created a separate folder named 

certificates for storing the certificates I created.
